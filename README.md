# Thief-s-Heist
A store has a line of n items placed on a counter, where the i-th item has a value of a_i. A thief wants to steal as much as possible, but if they steal everything, the owner will notice. Therefore, when the thief steals the i-th item, they cannot steal the two items immediately to its left or the two items immediately to its right.
Help determine the maximum possible total value the thief can steal.

Input : a natural number n and integer values of the sequence a_i (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).

Output : print the maximum possible total value of the stolen items.
